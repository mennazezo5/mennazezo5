%     SUMMARY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary}
I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in Software Testing and Quality Assurance. Alongside my core CS studies, I have been exposed to Artificial Intelligence concepts through academic coursework, which has enriched my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. I am actively studying Software Testing principles, including manual and automation testing using JavaScript, Python, and Selenium, with plans to further expand into Java-based frameworks. I am passionate about improving software quality and continuously learning new tools and practices.
